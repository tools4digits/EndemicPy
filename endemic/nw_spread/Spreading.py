        - contact_structure: An object of the contact_structure class
            (one of its subclasses), holding an ensemble of Host class
            objects.
            The spreading process will take place on this object.

            ensemble of Strain class objects.
        - treatment: An object of the treatment class, holding an
            ensemble of drug class objects.
        - **params: Additional parameters for the simulation:
            - t_max: gives the maximal time after which the simulation
                stops.  Defaults=1000
            - t_burn: time window for the exclusive spread of the wild type.
            - dt: the time step at which the current status should be recorded.
            - default_susceptibility: Value [0,1] to be used for any missing
                susceptibility.
                Default=1.

                on contact between a carrying and a susceptible individual
                several transmission events should be possible or not.
                Note: Traditional SIS, SIR or similar processes are not

    def run(self, phases):
        """
        This method runs through a list of phases.

        Each phase is a dictionary and each entry in this dictionary can be
        seen as a task. You might just specify a single task for a phase or
        several but in order to keep things tractable, use as few tasks as
        possible for a phase.

        All tasks
        Below are all possible tasks listed.

        Possible tasks:

            'new_infection': {strain_name: 'random'/IDs/other_strain}
                This will introduce a strain into the population.
                The strain_name specifies which strain should be
                introduced, 'random'/IDs/other_strain will specifies who should
                be infected.
                (see self._initiate_infection method for details)
            'parameter_alternation': {strain_name: {some_rate: value}}}
                This will change parameters of the pathogen.
                (see self._parameter_alternation method for detail
                Note: if Default values were set for the mutation selection
                    rate they need to be set again.
            't_start': float
            't_stop': float
                If t_stop is provided the method will try to take out events
                from the event queue until it finds an event with t <= t_stop
                (or some other halt condition is met - like the
                assert_survival task below)
                Note: it might be that a phase does not run until t_stop but
                    ends earlier (e.g. if 'building_up' task if provided -
                    see below). For such cases we cannot tell at what time the
                    phase ends and thus at what time the next phase should
                    start. For this there is the self._phase_passon attribute
                    which will be used

            'dt': float
                Can be used to specify the time interval for which the current
                status should be reported. This only really is useful if
                'explicit': True (see below).
            'with_treatment': boolean
            'with_selection': boolean
                If provided will force the scenario to use the specific event
                handler. If not provided both default to False.
            'treating': [strain_name, ...]
                If only some strains should be treated you can specify them
                with the 'treating' task. If 'treating' is not provided but
                'with_treatment': True, all strains are treated (if the
                scenario has drug for them).
                So, best always provide the 'treating' task.
            'assert_survival': [strain_name, ...]
                If this task is provided, the simulation stops if one of the
                specified strain dies out.
            'halt_condition': [strain_name, ...]
                If provided the halt_condition task will check if the
                specified strains are in QSS and if so, stop the simulation.
            'building_up': {strain_name: value, ref} the value indicates the
                amount of refs that should be infected with the indicated
                strain. If during the phase this values is attained
                (or exceeded) the phase is stopped and the scenario time
                (self.t) is returned. The building up can either be relative or
                absolute.
                For relative building up, a typical configuration could look as
                follows:
                    'building_up': {
                        'relative': {mutant_1: (0.9, total_infected)}
                    }
                    This reads: the building up stops once the mutant_1 strain
                    reached 90% of the total number of infected.
                    Alternatively 'total_infected' can be replaced by 'total'
                    which would mean the total number of hosts or by any other
                    name of present strains, e.g. the wild_type.
            'explicit': integer.
                This task forces the scenario to provide detailed status
                reports over the entire simulation. If explicit==1, then on
                every self.dt the self.get_outcome is written into
                self.simulation_log.
                If explicit==2, then on every self.dt the current status is
                written into self.outcome (slowdown!).
            'incremental': string.
                This task only works if explicit==True. It will write every
                event to the specified output file. Note that the file is
                opened in append mode so to be able to write several phases
                into the same file. Be sure to change the file name for each
                run as otherwise several runs might be written into the same
                file.
            'shuffle': dict. with 'source', 'target', 'substitute' and 'mode':
                This task will shuffle in the specified way the infection
                status of hosts.
                'target' must be a list of pathogen names and/or 'susc' for
                susceptible indicating the group of hosts withing which a
                shuffle should take place.
                'source' a list of pathogen names and/or 'susc' for
                susceptible indicating the group that should be distributed
                within the target group.
                'substitute' a list of pathogen names and/or 'susc' if this
                list is not empty, all hosts of the source group will get
                assigned randomly a state from the substitute list.
                'mode': optional argument (default value is 'keep') determines
                how the recover times should be handled.
                Possible values are 'keep', 'reset', 'source', 'both'.
                    'keep' will not reset the recover times and 'reset' will
                    reset all the recover times. 'source' only resets the
                    recover times of all the source nodes and 'both' will reset
                    the recover times for both 'source' and 'target'
                example: 'shuffle': {
                    'target' = [wild_type, mutant_1],
                    'source': [wild_type, mutant_1],
                    'substitute': []
                    }
                    This will redistribute the status of all the hosts infected
                    with either wild_type or mutant_1 among themselves.
                    Note that only the current views and the node ids in the
                    priority queue are updated.
            'state_change': dict with either 'node' or 'relative' and an
                optional 'mode'. If 'node', for each node id give a new token.
                New tokens are either pathogen names or 'susc' for susceptible
                (later 'r' for resistant)
                If 'relative' a dict needs to be provided, specifying what
                token to replace (key) with how much of what e.g.
                'wild_type': (0.5, 'mutant_1') reads replace 0.5 of the
                wild_types with a mutant_1 token. If 'mode' is present the
                event queue is reset with the given mode. If mode is 'keep'
                then the newly introduced tokens will keep the recover times of
                their previous token, with exception of those that were
                initially susceptible. If mode is 'reset' all the recover times
                are reset.
                Infection times for neighbouring nodes are reset no matter
                what.
                Example:
                    - 'state_change': {1: 'mutant_1', 2: 'wild_type', ...}
                        will simply change the token of node 1 to 'mutant_1'
                        and of node 2 to 'wild_type'.
                        Note that the pathogenic parameters are not reset, i.e.
                        node 1 will keep its previous recover time and continue
                        to infect with its previous token.
                    - 'state_change': {'mode': 'reset', 1: 'mutant_1'}
                        will change the token for node 1 to mutant_1 and draw a
                        new recovery time for node_1 as well as new infection
                        events for its neighbours.
            'reset_recovery': boolean. If true, all the recover times will be
                reset (drawn from the recover rate dists)
                Note: reset_recovery will automatically reset all the
                transmission times.
            'reset_transmission': True or dict. If True then all the
                transmission times are reset without resetting the recovery
                times. If dict, then the reset mode is taken from the dict.
                E.g.
                    'reset_transmission': {'mode': 'reset'}
                    will also reset the recover times. Possible values for
                    'mode' are 'reset' and 'keep'.
                    Default is 'keep'.
            'add_treatment': adds a new treatment to the existing scenario.
                Note that the treatment status is not changed, i.e. just
                adding a new treatment will not lead to an actual treatment.
                You'll need to provide the 'with_treatment': True task to run
                the simulation with a treatment.
